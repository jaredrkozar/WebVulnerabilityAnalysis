This vulnerability has multiple attack vectors and CIA impact.  Please review the following guidance from Microsoft for more information:

An attack against a user's local Excel client can result in remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attack against a Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 site can result in elevation of privilege. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain an elevation of privilege within SharePoint server, as opposed to elevation of privilege within the workstation or server environment.
